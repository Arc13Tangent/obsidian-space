TBH, Iâ€™m not actually sure what the unit for the "2" in `<font size=2>` is. XD I just noticed that when it's set to "3", it looks like the normal text size.

```html
<font size=2>
The code block style in my local vault is created using the Code Styler plugin.
</font>
```

The result:
<font size=2>
The code block style in my local vault is created using the Code Styler plugin.
</font>
