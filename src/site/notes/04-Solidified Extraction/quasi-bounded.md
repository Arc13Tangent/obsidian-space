## Definition

- $F : \mathbb{R}\ ×\ X → \mathbb{R}^N$: cont. functional

F is quasi-bounded if it is bdd on every bounded closed subset of $\mathbb{R}\ ×\ X$.

## Examples

The functional $F$ in [[04-Solidified Extraction/Locally-Lipschitz#DDE\|this example]] is quasi-bdd. (Check this by noting that cont. ft. maps cpt. set to cpt. set)
