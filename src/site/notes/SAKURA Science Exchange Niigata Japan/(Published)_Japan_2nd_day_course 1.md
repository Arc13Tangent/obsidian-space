# Graph Theory

Instructor: Professor Suzuki (鈴木教授)

- vertices 
  edges
- degree: 點上有幾條邊
  maximum degree
	Hand Shaking Lemma: sum. of deg. is the twice of the edge
	(PF: 在每個點旁邊的邊放tokens)
	Odd pt. thm.: the number of the vertices with odd deg is even XD
- Cycle: 踩點只能踩一次的圈圈
  Problems: 最長的和最短的cycle?
- simple graph: no self-loop
- Bipartite graph: 分兩邊，一邊的點和另一邊的所有點相連
  Partite sets
  Thm.: bip. if and only if it has no cycle of odd length
- Planar graph: can be drawn w/o crossing
  - Dual of p. graph: place vertices at regions and join all vertices "near" it
    Fact: odd-sided poly. can not be divided into even-sided polygons 
    (Pf: take dual, contradict with odd pt. thm.)
  - planar even-sided graph
    Fact: any above graph is bip. 
    (Pf: 你假設有一個odd cycle，那裡面一定要有一個點，和上一個fact矛盾)
- Four color problem (thm.)
  Thm.: any map on the plane can be colored by 4 colors
- cube flip
