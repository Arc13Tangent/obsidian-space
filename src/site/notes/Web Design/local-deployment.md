The [Digital Garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) is fantastic. It's free and open source, and the service it depends on, Vercel, has a free version.
However, the free version of Vercel has a limit on the number of deployments, which is 100 per day. We may run out of the quota if we want to tune some details.
Thankfully, the plugin's author provided a local deployment method that works well.
I just put some further details in here for documentation.
Full discussion: [Local deployment 路 oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden 路 Discussion (github.com)](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/discussions/160)

1. Clone the digital garden repo (we might have done this before if we've already modified the `custom-style.scss` or other files to customize our garden)
2. In terminal, cd to the repo folder, type `npm install express --save`
```shell ln:false
> cd <path to the repo>
> npm install express --save
```

3. On the same place, add a new file `app.js` with the following content:
```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 8080; 

app.use(express.static('dist'))

app.get('*', (req, res)=>{
  res.redirect("/404")
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Digital garden running on port ${port}`)
})   
```

> [!info] Some modifications
> If we just paste the original code and execute `app.js` in the last step, we might get an error `Error: Cannot find module './netlify/functions/search/search.js'`, so we remove the code related to it.

4. On terminal, execute the following:
```shell ln:false
> npm install
> npm run build
> node app.js
```

5. On the browser, type `localhost:8080`, our garden should appear

After we made some changes, to see the new contents, first type `ctrl` + `c` to interrupt the current one, then type `npm run build` and `node app.js` again.
