<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PacJp3YdhrNR9wzc5ylpH6nkcmLvHjVM/preview" 
width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay" aspect-ratio="4 / 4">
</iframe>
```

The result:
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PacJp3YdhrNR9wzc5ylpH6nkcmLvHjVM/preview" 
width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay" aspect-ratio="4 / 4">
