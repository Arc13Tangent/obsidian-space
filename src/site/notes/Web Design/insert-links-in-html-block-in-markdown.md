Note that this type of link only works after being published to DG. In Obsidian, itâ€™s just an underlined, clickable string...

```html
<center>
<a href="https://obsidian-space-delta.vercel.app/">atan's OuOb Space!</a>
</center>
```

The result:
<center>
<a href="https://obsidian-space-delta.vercel.app/">atan's OuOb Space!</a>
